Python-Based IDE Project
A powerful yet simple Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to enhance productivity for Python developers and data scientists. The IDE comes with modern features like debugging, intelligent auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and more to provide an efficient coding experience for writing, debugging, and testing Python code.
Features
-Full-Featured Code Editor:
Supports Python syntax highlighting, linting, and error reporting in real-time.
Line numbering, bracket matching, and code folding for better readability and navigation.
-Syntax Highlighting and Linting:
Comprehensive highlighting for keywords, variables, classes, and more.
Real-time linting using pylint for instant feedback on code quality.
-Debugging with Visual Breakpoints:
Integrated with Python's pdb for debugging, including stepping through code and inspecting variables.
Set visual breakpoints directly in the editor by clicking on the line number.
-Code Snippets and Custom Templates:
Predefined snippets for common Python constructs like loops, functions, and classes.
Easily create and manage custom templates for recurring code patterns.
-Autosave and Session Restore:
Autosave functionality that prevents data loss by saving work periodically.
Session restore feature that reopens all previously open files and their unsaved changes upon IDE restart.
-Customizable Shortcuts:
Set default keyboard shortcuts for common actions like saving, running, and debugging.
Fully customizable shortcuts to tailor your workflow.
-Command Palette:
Inspired by popular IDEs, enabling quick access to commands and IDE functions through typed input.
Integrated File Explorer:
A file explorer for browsing directories, creating new files/folders, and navigating project structures directly within the IDE.
-Lightweight and Fast:
Optimized for performance with lazy loading of large files and incremental linting, ensuring a responsive user experience.
Project Scope
-The Python-Based IDE aims to serve:
Beginner Developers looking for an accessible yet effective Python coding environment.
Data Scientists who need a straightforward interface to write, test, and debug Python scripts quickly.
Advanced Developers who need productivity features such as debugging, code navigation, and code snippets for efficient development.
The primary goal is to provide an intuitive coding experience while maintaining all essential tools needed to write, debug, and maintain Python code efficiently.
